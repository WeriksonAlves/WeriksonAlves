### Hello, welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is Werikson Frederiko, and I am a dedicated graduate student in Computer Science at UFV. My academic journey began with an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at the same institution, where I delved into various fields of robotics, refining my expertise in computer vision and machine learning techniques. Taking advantage of techniques such as KNN and Principal Component Analysis, using programming languages such as MatLab and Python. 

Following a pragmatic approach, I am tirelessly committed to achieving tangible results through dedication and persistence. My philosophy revolves around a complete understanding of tasks, striving for optimum efficiency at every step. Accepting challenges is second nature to me, as I continually seek opportunities for personal and collective growth. 

I am currently immersed in innovative research at the NÃºcleo de EspecializaÃ§Ã£o em RobÃ³tica - NERo, where my focus is predominantly in the field of image pattern recognition.
